# Food Delivery Operational Analytics: SQL Project

## Overview
This project utilizes SQL to analyze food delivery data, revealing key operational insights such as order frequency, delivery efficiency, and customer trends. By leveraging advanced SQL techniques, the project provides data-driven recommendations to improve business operations and optimize logistics.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Database:** SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Techniques:** Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries, Data Filtering
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Data Structure & Processing
- **Tables Overview:**  
  - **Orders:** Contains order details including timestamps, order values, and delivery status.  
  - **Customers:** Stores customer information and ordering behavior.  
  - **Restaurants:** Lists restaurant details and menu offerings.  
  - **Delivery Partners:** Captures data related to delivery personnel and performance.

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**  
  - Handle missing values and inconsistencies across tables.  
  - Standardize data formats (e.g., dates and numerical fields).  
  - Perform necessary joins to integrate data for comprehensive analysis.

## Analysis Process
- **Query Development:**  
  - Construct complex SQL queries to aggregate data and extract key metrics.
  - Utilize subqueries and joins to link data from multiple tables.

- **Aggregation & Reporting:**  
  - Calculate average delivery times, order volumes, and customer order patterns.
  - Identify peak order hours and performance bottlenecks.

- **Insight Generation:**  
  - Uncover trends in customer behavior and restaurant performance.
  - Identify operational inefficiencies and propose actionable recommendations.

## Key Insights
- **Operational Efficiency:** Identification of peak order times and evaluation of delivery performance.
- **Customer Behavior:** Analysis of ordering patterns to inform targeted marketing and service improvements.
- **Business Impact:** Actionable observations for optimizing delivery routes and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Future Enhancements
- Develop stored procedures to automate regular report generation.
- Integrate with Python for advanced visualization and deeper, interactive analytics.
- Extend analysis to include additional variables like geographical data for further segmentation.
